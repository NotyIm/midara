# midara

A very simple CI server.

# Warning

I used it to build noty.im infrastructure. However, since it runs shell, it's
best to run Midara in a private, heavily firewall network.

Currently I only allow build from Github.

# Why

Tired of using YAML file in CI. This CI bring back the power of bash. Yes, you
write bash script to run build/deploy. The CI, however, exposed a set of bash
function you can use.

When receiving a web hook, Midara gather information about the commit (repo,
owner, user, commit, branch, pr...), create a workspace, checkout your code
into that workspace, source your build script with `source .midara`.


# Shell structure:

You have to export a variable name `DOCKER_IMAGE`.

# Build process
